# URL Shortener - Alicia BE Assignment - Medior

## Introduction
Welcome to the **URL Shortener** assignment!

Your task is to implement a **simple URL shortener API** using **Django** and **Django REST Framework (DRF)**. This application allows users to submit a long URL and receive a shortened URL. When a user accesses the short URL, they should be redirected to the original URL.  

We've provided a **basic Django project setup** to save you time. Your job is to implement the required functionality using **best practices**.

---

## Scenario
Imagine you're building a **miniature version of bit.ly** or **TinyURL**. Users should be able to:  

1. Submit a long URL via an API endpoint and receive a shortened version.  
2. Use the short URL to be redirected to the original long URL.  
3. (Bonus) View basic statistics about the shortened URL (e.g., number of times accessed).  

---

## Assignment Requirements
You need to implement the following features:  

* **Shorten a URL**: Accept a long URL via an API endpoint and return a unique short URL.  
* **Redirect to Original URL**: When a user visits the short URL, they should be redirected to the original long URL.  
* **Validation**: Ensure the input is a valid URL.  
* **Database Storage**: Store the original and shortened URLs in SQLite.  
* **API Implementation**: Use Django REST Framework (DRF) to expose the necessary endpoints.  
* **Code Structure & Best Practices**: Follow Djangoâ€™s best practices for project structure, error handling, and API design.  

### Bonus (Optional)
* Track the number of times a short URL has been accessed.  
* Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.  
* Allow users to specify a custom short URL (e.g., `https://yourshortener.com/mycustomlink`).

## Project Setup & Installation

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/url-shortener.git
cd url-shortener
```

**2. Create & Activate a Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

**3. Install the Requirements**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Apply Migrations & Start the Server**
```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
## 5. API Endpoints

| Method  | Endpoint              | Description |
|---------|-----------------------|-------------|
| `POST`  | `/api/shorten/`       | Submit a long URL and receive a short URL. |
| `GET`   | `/short/<short_code>/` | Redirect to the original long URL. |
| (Bonus) `GET`  | `/api/stats/<short_code>/` | Retrieve stats for a short URL (e.g., access count). |

## What Weâ€™re Evaluating
* Code quality & structure
* Django best practices
* API design & error handling
* Database modeling
* Security considerations
* Performance optimizations (if any)

## Questions to Think About
After submission, we may ask you some questions, such as:
* How did you generate the short URL?
* How would you scale this application for millions of users?
* What security concerns exist with URL shorteners?
* ...

## Submission Instructions
* Fork this repository.
* Implement your solution in a new branch.
* Create a pull request (PR) with a summary of your implementation.
* Be ready to discuss your decisions during the review!

## Good Luck & Have Fun!
